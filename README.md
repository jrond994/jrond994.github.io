# CEE 598 Homework 6

## Problem 1
Create a scientific communication post where you discuss how the emission pricing system for sustainable transportation networks could be implemented in practice.

### Discussion

```
Urban environments represent close to 32% of total lane miles in the US [1], but in 2012 (CO<sub>2</sub>) vehicle emissions coming from urban environments represented 62% of total emissions[2]. Urban transportation networks significantly contribute to the aggregate of vehicle emissions, which makes the case for policies aimed at reducing these emissions.<br/>
<br/>
To materialize emission pricing in an urban environment, policy has to be enacted setting the pricing scheme and conditions, wheter this is the geographic area where it will apply, rates, types of vehicles included,etc. The implementation of a policy of this kind, like any other, has one very important element to it, which is public acceptance. Without this element, policies of this kind will not be implemented or will not last. This is covered in great detail by [3], who illustrates why as of 2021, less than a dozen cities around the world have succesfully implemented road/zone pricing schemes for urban transportation.<br/>
<br/>
Pricing schemes can be motivated by a number of factors but they are always implemented with the goal of congestion reduction or the combined goal of congestion reduction and emissions reduction. A notable case were emissions and also air quality took more relevance was the city of Milan [4], where a 14% reduction in (CO<sub>2</sub>) emissions was achieved through the implementation of congestion surcharge in a specific area of the city.

## Problem 2
Each team should pick a published newspaper or online article related to a topic discussed in class (indicative articles are provided below) and explain in layperson terms the science behind these phenomena or the science behind proposing an interventions such as pricing schemes.
