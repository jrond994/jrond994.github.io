# CEE 598 Homework 6

## Problem 1
Create a scientific communication post where you discuss how the emission pricing system for sustainable transportation networks could be implemented in practice.

### Discussion


Urban environments represent close to 32% of total lane miles in the US [1], but in 2012 CO<sub>2</sub> vehicle emissions coming from urban environments represented 62% of total emissions [2]. Urban transportation networks significantly contribute to the aggregate of vehicle emissions, which makes the case for policies aimed at reducing these emissions.<br/>

To materialize emission pricing in an urban environment, policy has to be enacted setting the pricing scheme and conditions, whether this is the geographic area where it will apply, rates, types of vehicles included, etc. The implementation of a policy of this kind, like any other, has one very important element to it, which is public acceptance. Without this element, even if the policy will benefit citizens, it is not likely to be implemented, mainly because of the political cost that public officials would have to assume. This is covered in great detail by [3], who illustrates why as of 2021, less than a dozen cities around the world have successfully implemented road/zone pricing schemes for urban transportation. A good example of this is the city of New York, where pricing schemes for the busiest  area of Manhattan have been suggested since 2007, where only approved in 2019 and are only starting to be applied in 2021 for transportation services like Uber and Lyft.

Pricing schemes can be motivated by a number of factors, but they are always implemented with the goal of congestion reduction or the combined goal of congestion reduction and emissions reduction. A notable case were emissions and air quality took more relevance was the city of Milan [4], where a 14% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was achieved through the implementation of congestion surcharge in a specific area of the city.

The application of these pricing schemes, till this day, has taken in almost every case the form of a congestion charge zone, a cordoned zone of the city where drivers have to pay to enter, which deters them from accessing the zone, or at least to a certain extent. Examples of this are the cities of London, Stockholm, and Milan. In the US, areas have been defined in Chicago and New York, but only some transportation services are subject to the surcharge.

One may think that best way to apply an emission pricing scheme would be to track every vehicle in the city, and based on certain known vehicle characteristics and the effective milage, tax the estimated emissions of such vehicle. While this would be the most effective scheme in terms of targeting emissions, concerns can be raised from many perspectives ranging from citizens right to privacy to equity issues, this is not even considering public acceptance. 

They key aspect for the application of an emission pricing system remains to be public acceptance, a series of steps are described by [3] to correctly implement a pricing scheme in Geneva, Switzerland. While the technical design of the policy matters, what matters most is how the design and other aspects not relating to will affect public acceptance. In other words, even if the perfect policy is devised from a technical point of view, it will be only as good as the reaction it generates in the public. [3] describes how different aspects will impact public support:

Technical aspects:
- Surcharge rate
- Exempted categories
- Dynamic surcharge versus constant 

Non technical
- Information provided about direct benefits (air quality)
- Revenue dedication
- Showing immediate benefits to the population

Findings are that constant rates are more widely accepted by citizens than dynamic ones, and it is also notable that as the surcharge rate increases, acceptance decreases.
Another not so obvious founding is that the type of exemptions enacted can also affect acceptance, the public is more inclined towards exemptions to locals rather than exemptions to certain vehicles like hybrid or electric ones. On the non-technical side, showing that the policy is not only aimed at revenue collection is just as important as dedicating the revenue to projects that will immediately  impact citizens in a positive way. Also important is the communication of the environmental benefits that will result from the policy, like the improvement of air quality or the reduction of noise.

Many of these issues seem unrelated to the technical design, but for now, it seems that the surcharge zones dominate the effective applications of these policies, while details non-pertaining to the immediate field of emission pricing are far more relevant to the correct application, than the pricing scheme itself.

## Problem 2
Each team should pick a published newspaper or online article related to a topic discussed in class (indicative articles are provided below) and explain in layperson terms the science behind these phenomena or the science behind proposing an interventions such as pricing schemes.

### Article selected: **USA Today, Congestion Pricing**

### Explanation

In reality, traffic flow of an urban area transportation network will converge to the state of user equilibrium. It means that the journey times in all routes actually used are equal and less than those that would be experienced by a single vehicle on any unused route [1] when each user chooses the route that is the best. However, this is not the system optimal where total system travel cost is minimized. In order to improve the traffic network performance we usually apply congestion pricing scheme such that we will charge drivers money if they get into the congestion area. Using pricing scheme, we can chenge the incentive of drivers for their rout choice and optimize the total traveling time of the system. Recently, New York City launched a policy of congestion pricing in Manhattan. 

Most of people are positive about this policy. Congestion pricing scheme is already proved to be effecitve in reducing traffic jams and improve air quality in other large cities such as London and Singapore. Also, although New York has high population density, it has strong and robust public transportation system [2]. It is still able to serve the citizens of urban transport when citizens refuse to drive their vehicles because of the additional congestion charging. 

However, we still have serveral critical questions to be solved before implementing this policy in practice. First of all, we need to install some smart sensors that can read the license plate when the vehicle is moving fast, which will need budget to improve the infrastructure system. Second, large proportion of the vehicles entering Manhattan consists of delivery trucks, taxis and ride-hail vehicles. Whether these drivers are willing to give up their benefits of their service to avoid congestion fee remains doubtful.

Mitchell Moss, director of the Rudin Center for Transportation Policy and Management at New York University, claims that this policy may not be able to promot traffic network service performance in a significant way while it can serve as a new revenue source. On the contrary,
Kate Slevin, senior vice president of state programs and advocacy at Regional Plan Association, believes that "even a small reduction in traffic can have a substantial impact on the larger traffic network‚Äù [3].

We still need to wait several years before the congestion toll is turned on. Nevertheless, it is time for us to think about this issue and purpose some advice for our urban traffic system in the future.
