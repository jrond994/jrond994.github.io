# CEE 598 Homework 6

## Problem 1
Create a scientific communication post where you discuss how the emission pricing system for sustainable transportation networks could be implemented in practice.

### Discussion


Urban environments represent close to 32% of total lane miles in the US [1], but in 2012 CO<sub>2</sub> vehicle emissions coming from urban environments represented 62% of total emissions [2]. Urban transportation networks significantly contribute to the aggregate of vehicle emissions, which makes the case for policies aimed at reducing these emissions.<br/>

To materialize emission pricing in an urban environment, policy has to be enacted setting the pricing scheme and conditions, wheter this is the geographic area where it will apply, rates, types of vehicles included,etc. The implementation of a policy of this kind, like any other, has one very important element to it, which is public acceptance. Without this element, policies of this kind will not be implemented or will not last. This is covered in great detail by [3], who illustrates why as of 2021, less than a dozen cities around the world have succesfully implemented road/zone pricing schemes for urban transportation. A good example of this is the city of New York, where pricing schemes for the bussiest area of Manhattan have been suggested since 2007, where only approved in 2019 and are starting to be applied in 2021 for transporation services like Uber and Lyft.

Pricing schemes can be motivated by a number of factors but they are always implemented with the goal of congestion reduction or the combined goal of congestion reduction and emissions reduction. A notable case were emissions and also air quality took more relevance was the city of Milan [4], where a 14% reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions was achieved through the implementation of congestion surcharge in a specific area of the city.

The application of these pricing schemes, till this day, has taken in almost every case the form of a congestion charge zone, a cordoned zone of the city where drivers have to pay to enter, which deters them from accessing the zone, or at least to a certain extent. Examples of this are the cities of London, Stockholm and Milan. In the US, areas have been defined in Chicago and New York, but only some transportation services are subject to the surcharge.

One may think that best way to apply an emission pricing scheme would be to track every vehicle in the city, and based on certain known vehicle characteristics and the effective milage, tax the estimated emissions of such vehicle. While this would be the most effective scheme in terms of targeting emissions, concerns can be raised from many perspectives ranging from citizens right to privacy to equity issues, this is not even considering public acceptance.
